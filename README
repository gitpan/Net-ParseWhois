The original maintainer for Net::Parse::Whois has been MIA for many years. 
I adopted the project back in 2005 and fixed a number of problems it had. 
But sadly I did not have the time to polish it and update it on CPAN.

Now, finally, about 3 years later I can upload it to CPAN! Additional 
registrars will *definitely* be added but I can't promise any specific one 
or a time-line.

If you have any bugfixes or additions, please feel free to e-mail me!
